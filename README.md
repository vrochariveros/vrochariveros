*Hi there!* ðŸ‘‹
### Welcome to my GitHub!
## My name is **Veronica**

I am a highly motivated **Data Analyst** with a passion for _Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning._

***I was recently accepted into a fully funded data science boot camp with Co Grammar, which I'm currently participating in and it's been an amazing experience. 
Earlier this year I participated in Code Instituteâ€™s 5-day coding challenge as an introduction to code and pursued self-learning through courses on Code Academy, focusing on Python, SQL, and coding fundamentals.***

My background includes roles as a BIM Engineer and Reevo, where sustainability in the built environment was a central focus, I understand the importance of leveraging data to drive impactful decisions. 

My academic qualifications, including a Bachelor's in Architecture, an MSc in Sustainable Building Technology, and an MA in Design and Visualisation, provide me with a unique interdisciplinary perspective that enriches my approach to data analysis.

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of applying my passion for sustainability and innovation to develop data-driven solutions that address complex challenges.
